# Code Aging Visualization for Brackets

This extension shows the maturity of your code. It will fade out older lines of code
with a green background, making those new lines of code that typically contain 90% of
your newly introduced bugs very prominent. Think of grass growing over your mature code -
no need to disturb it!
